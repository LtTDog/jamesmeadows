<b><p style="font-family:segoe script">I wanted to do this memorial for you Jimmy, my love, you touch so many lives here on earth, you were always a friend when someone needed it, even me, I could watch you do things for someone or playing with the grandchildren and fall in love with you all over again.  Your jokes, teasing, and that wonderful smile could melt me in a second. You gave me the most wonderful 23 years of my life.</p>

<p style="font-family:segoe script">The guys you worked with, you loved your fellow workers, there was no one you wouldn't help if they needed it.  When you joined the Plumbers & Pipefitters Local 189, you were so excited, it was what you had been working for.  You had acquired so many friends, they were there for us, and for me when I lost you.</p>

<p style="font-family:segoe script">Jimmy was in the United States Navy.</p>

<p style="font-family:segoe script">I miss you so much my heart aches, for you, I love you always and will never forget the beautiful love we share.</p>

<p style="font-family:segoe script">You are missed by all your friends, family, your children (Natalie (Matt) and Jeff(Tracy), all you grandchildren including  Clayton and Brayan, you sister April, and your brother Mike(Kim), my family, Terry and Paul (Stacy), all your nephews and nieces, and your in-laws and me.</p>
